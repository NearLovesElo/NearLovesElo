# 👋 Hi there, I'm Marcus Kyle Jamison!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I'm a 4th year (next semester) BSEMC major in Game Development with beginner game developer skills and constantly improving my skills in Unity and C# language. Here are some of my projects:

---

## 🎮 My Unity Projects

### 🏚️ Eldershard
A game about surviving a haunted mansion where statues move when unobserved. Players must search for the Eldershard to save a missing father—before they, too, are turned to stone.

### 🎡 Midnight Carnival
A game about guarding a haunted carnival at night. Players must shut down all the rides before dawn while battling creeping madness and unseen horrors.
