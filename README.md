👋 Hi, I'm Marcus Kyle Jamison!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I'm a 4th-year BSEMC student majoring in Game Development, with a strong focus on programming and understanding how things work behind the scenes.

I enjoy building games not just for visuals, but to explore how game logic, systems, and interactions are created through code.
I mainly work with Unity, C#, and SpacetimeDB, constantly learning better ways to structure, optimize, and organize my code.
